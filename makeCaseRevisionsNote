makecase revisios note:

makeCaseRev0	the priority for the casetype is not check in case of array
makeCaseRev1	priority for the casetype is check in case of array,
		but to make it easy to put vovwel and consonant in the middle or ordered array
		all the high priority cases and somaller priority cases are swapped by.push
makeCase 	if the final version. It works base on priority and does not swap the case request if they have the same priority.
              

Comments:          
Main difficulty to understand how to create an array of functions. 
Then how to re-arrange the array case at the input of the function base on the precedence. 
I am not sure if I understood completely the priority requirement and therefore I may not consider all cases. 
I assume some refactoring is required.
